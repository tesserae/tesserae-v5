<cowper task 1.1>	I sing the Sofa.  I, who lately sang
<cowper task 1.2>	Truth, Hope, and Charity, and touched with awe
<cowper task 1.3>	The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,
<cowper task 1.4>	Escaped with pain from that advent'rous flight,
<cowper task 1.5>	Now seek repose upon a humbler theme:
<cowper task 1.6>	The theme though humble, yet august and proud
<cowper task 1.7>	The occasion--for the Fair commands the song.
<cowper task 1.8>	Time was, when clothing sumptuous or for use,
<cowper task 1.9>	Save their own painted skins, our sires had none.
<cowper task 1.10>	As yet black breeches were not; satin smooth,
<cowper task 1.11>	Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:
<cowper task 1.12>	The hardy chief upon the rugged rock
<cowper task 1.13>	Washed by the sea, or on the gravelly bank
<cowper task 1.14>	Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,
<cowper task 1.15>	Fearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength.
<cowper task 1.16>	Those barbarous ages past, succeeded next
<cowper task 1.17>	The birthday of invention; weak at first,
<cowper task 1.18>	Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.
<cowper task 1.19>	Joint-stools were then created; on three legs
<cowper task 1.20>	Upborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm
<cowper task 1.21>	A massy slab, in fashion square or round.
<cowper task 1.22>	On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,
<cowper task 1.23>	And swayed the sceptre of his infant realms;
<cowper task 1.24>	And such in ancient halls and mansions drear
<cowper task 1.25>	May still be seen, but perforated sore
<cowper task 1.26>	And drilled in holes the solid oak is found,
<cowper task 1.27>	By worms voracious eating through and through.
<cowper task 1.28>	At length a generation more refined
<cowper task 1.29>	Improved the simple plan, made three legs four,
<cowper task 1.30>	Gave them a twisted form vermicular,
<cowper task 1.31>	And o'er the seat, with plenteous wadding stuffed,
<cowper task 1.32>	Induced a splendid cover green and blue,
<cowper task 1.33>	Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought
<cowper task 1.34>	And woven close, or needlework sublime.
<cowper task 1.35>	There might ye see the peony spread wide,
<cowper task 1.36>	The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,
<cowper task 1.37>	Lapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes,
<cowper task 1.38>	And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.
<cowper task 1.39>	Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright
<cowper task 1.40>	With Nature's varnish; severed into stripes
<cowper task 1.41>	That interlaced each other, these supplied,
<cowper task 1.42>	Of texture firm, a lattice-work that braced
<cowper task 1.43>	The new machine, and it became a chair.
<cowper task 1.44>	But restless was the chair; the back erect
<cowper task 1.45>	Distressed the weary loins that felt no ease;
<cowper task 1.46>	The slippery seat betrayed the sliding part
<cowper task 1.47>	That pressed it, and the feet hung dangling down,
<cowper task 1.48>	Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.
<cowper task 1.49>	These for the rich:  the rest, whom fate had placed
<cowper task 1.50>	In modest mediocrity, content
<cowper task 1.51>	With base materials, sat on well-tanned hides
<cowper task 1.52>	Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,
<cowper task 1.53>	With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,
<cowper task 1.54>	Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed:
<cowper task 1.55>	If cushion might be called, what harder seemed
<cowper task 1.56>	Than the firm oak of which the frame was formed.
<cowper task 1.57>	No want of timber then was felt or feared
<cowper task 1.58>	In Albion's happy isle.  The lumber stood
<cowper task 1.59>	Ponderous, and fixed by its own massy weight.
<cowper task 1.60>	But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,
<cowper task 1.61>	An alderman of Cripplegate contrived,
<cowper task 1.62>	And some ascribe the invention to a priest
<cowper task 1.63>	Burly and big, and studious of his ease.
<cowper task 1.64>	But rude at first, and not with easy slope
<cowper task 1.65>	Receding wide, they pressed against the ribs,
<cowper task 1.66>	And bruised the side, and elevated high
<cowper task 1.67>	Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears.
<cowper task 1.68>	Long time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires
<cowper task 1.69>	Complained, though incommodiously pent in,
<cowper task 1.70>	And ill at ease behind.  The ladies first
<cowper task 1.71>	Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.
<cowper task 1.72>	Ingenious fancy, never better pleased
<cowper task 1.73>	Than when employed to accommodate the fair,
<cowper task 1.74>	Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised
<cowper task 1.75>	The soft settee; one elbow at each end,
<cowper task 1.76>	And in the midst an elbow, it received,
<cowper task 1.77>	United yet divided, twain at once.
<cowper task 1.78>	So sit two kings of Brentford on one throne;
<cowper task 1.79>	And so two citizens who take the air,
<cowper task 1.80>	Close packed and smiling in a chaise and one.
<cowper task 1.81>	But relaxation of the languid frame
<cowper task 1.82>	By soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,
<cowper task 1.83>	Was bliss reserved for happier days; so slow
<cowper task 1.84>	The growth of what is excellent, so hard
<cowper task 1.85>	To attain perfection in this nether world.
<cowper task 1.86>	Thus first necessity invented stools,
<cowper task 1.87>	Convenience next suggested elbow-chairs,
<cowper task 1.88>	And luxury the accomplished Sofa last.
<cowper task 1.89>	The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick,
<cowper task 1.90>	Whom snoring she disturbs.  As sweetly he
<cowper task 1.91>	Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour
<cowper task 1.92>	To sleep within the carriage more secure,
<cowper task 1.93>	His legs depending at the open door.
<cowper task 1.94>	Sweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk,
<cowper task 1.95>	The tedious rector drawling o'er his head,
<cowper task 1.96>	And sweet the clerk below; but neither sleep
<cowper task 1.97>	Of lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead,
<cowper task 1.98>	Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour
<cowper task 1.99>	To slumber in the carriage more secure,
<cowper task 1.100>	Nor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk,
<cowper task 1.101>	Nor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet,
<cowper task 1.102>	Compared with the repose the Sofa yields.
<cowper task 1.103>	Oh, may I live exempted (while I live
<cowper task 1.104>	Guiltless of pampered appetite obscene)
<cowper task 1.105>	From pangs arthritic that infest the toe
<cowper task 1.106>	Of libertine excess.  The Sofa suits
<cowper task 1.107>	The gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb,
<cowper task 1.108>	Though on a Sofa, may I never feel:
<cowper task 1.109>	For I have loved the rural walk through lanes
<cowper task 1.110>	Of grassy swarth, close cropped by nibbling sheep,
<cowper task 1.111>	And skirted thick with intertexture firm
<cowper task 1.112>	Of thorny boughs:  have loved the rural walk
<cowper task 1.113>	O'er hills, through valleys, and by river's brink,
<cowper task 1.114>	E'er since a truant boy I passed my bounds
<cowper task 1.115>	To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.
<cowper task 1.116>	And still remember, nor without regret
<cowper task 1.117>	Of hours that sorrow since has much endeared,
<cowper task 1.118>	How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,
<cowper task 1.119>	Still hungering penniless and far from home,
<cowper task 1.120>	I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws,
<cowper task 1.121>	Or blushing crabs, or berries that emboss
<cowper task 1.122>	The bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.
<cowper task 1.123>	Hard fare! but such as boyish appetite
<cowper task 1.124>	Disdains not, nor the palate undepraved
<cowper task 1.125>	By culinary arts unsavoury deems.
<cowper task 1.126>	No Sofa then awaited my return,
<cowper task 1.127>	No Sofa then I needed.  Youth repairs
<cowper task 1.128>	His wasted spirits quickly, by long toil
<cowper task 1.129>	Incurring short fatigue; and though our years,
<cowper task 1.130>	As life declines, speed rapidly away,
<cowper task 1.131>	And not a year but pilfers as he goes
<cowper task 1.132>	Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep,
<cowper task 1.133>	A tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees
<cowper task 1.134>	Their length and colour from the locks they spare;
<cowper task 1.135>	The elastic spring of an unwearied foot
<cowper task 1.136>	That mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,
<cowper task 1.137>	That play of lungs inhaling and again
<cowper task 1.138>	Respiring freely the fresh air, that makes
<cowper task 1.139>	Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,
<cowper task 1.140>	Mine have not pilfered yet; nor yet impaired
<cowper task 1.141>	My relish of fair prospect; scenes that soothed
<cowper task 1.142>	Or charmed me young, no longer young, I find
<cowper task 1.143>	Still soothing and of power to charm me still.
<cowper task 1.144>	And witness, dear companion of my walks,
<cowper task 1.145>	Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive
<cowper task 1.146>	Fast locked in mine, with pleasure such as love,
<cowper task 1.147>	Confirmed by long experience of thy worth
<cowper task 1.148>	And well-tried virtues, could alone inspire--
<cowper task 1.149>	Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long.
<cowper task 1.150>	Thou know'st my praise of Nature most sincere,
<cowper task 1.151>	And that my raptures are not conjured up
<cowper task 1.152>	To serve occasions of poetic pomp,
<cowper task 1.153>	But genuine, and art partner of them all.
<cowper task 1.154>	How oft upon yon eminence, our pace
<cowper task 1.155>	Has slackened to a pause, and we have borne
<cowper task 1.156>	The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,
<cowper task 1.157>	While admiration feeding at the eye,
<cowper task 1.158>	And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene!
<cowper task 1.159>	Thence with what pleasure have we just discerned
<cowper task 1.160>	The distant plough slow-moving, and beside
<cowper task 1.161>	His labouring team, that swerved not from the track,
<cowper task 1.162>	The sturdy swain diminished to a boy!
<cowper task 1.163>	Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain
<cowper task 1.164>	Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er,
<cowper task 1.165>	Conducts the eye along his sinuous course
<cowper task 1.166>	Delighted.  There, fast rooted in his bank
<cowper task 1.167>	Stand, never overlooked, our favourite elms
<cowper task 1.168>	That screen the herdsman's solitary hut;
<cowper task 1.169>	While far beyond and overthwart the stream
<cowper task 1.170>	That, as with molten glass, inlays the vale,
<cowper task 1.171>	The sloping land recedes into the clouds;
<cowper task 1.172>	Displaying on its varied side the grace
<cowper task 1.173>	Of hedgerow beauties numberless, square tower,
<cowper task 1.174>	Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells
<cowper task 1.175>	Just undulates upon the listening ear;
<cowper task 1.176>	Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.
<cowper task 1.177>	Scenes must be beautiful which daily viewed
<cowper task 1.178>	Please daily, and whose novelty survives
<cowper task 1.179>	Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years:
<cowper task 1.180>	Praise justly due to those that I describe.
<cowper task 1.181>	Nor rural sights alone, but rural sounds
<cowper task 1.182>	Exhilarate the spirit, and restore
<cowper task 1.183>	The tone of languid Nature.  Mighty winds,
<cowper task 1.184>	That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood
<cowper task 1.185>	Of ancient growth, make music not unlike
<cowper task 1.186>	The dash of ocean on his winding shore,
<cowper task 1.187>	And lull the spirit while they fill the mind,
<cowper task 1.188>	Unnumbered branches waving in the blast,
<cowper task 1.189>	And all their leaves fast fluttering, all at once.
<cowper task 1.190>	Nor less composure waits upon the roar
<cowper task 1.191>	Of distant floods, or on the softer voice
<cowper task 1.192>	Of neighbouring fountain, or of rills that slip
<cowper task 1.193>	Through the cleft rock, and, chiming as they fall
<cowper task 1.194>	Upon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length
<cowper task 1.195>	In matted grass, that with a livelier green
<cowper task 1.196>	Betrays the secret of their silent course.
<cowper task 1.197>	Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds,
<cowper task 1.198>	But animated Nature sweeter still
<cowper task 1.199>	To soothe and satisfy the human ear.
<cowper task 1.200>	Ten thousand warblers cheer the day, and one
<cowper task 1.201>	The livelong night:  nor these alone whose notes
<cowper task 1.202>	Nice-fingered art must emulate in vain,
<cowper task 1.203>	But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime
<cowper task 1.204>	In still repeated circles, screaming loud,
<cowper task 1.205>	The jay, the pie, and even the boding owl
<cowper task 1.206>	That hails the rising moon, have charms for me.
<cowper task 1.207>	Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,
<cowper task 1.208>	Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,
<cowper task 1.209>	And only there, please highly for their sake.
<cowper task 1.210>	Peace to the artist, whose ingenious thought
<cowper task 1.211>	Devised the weather-house, that useful toy!
<cowper task 1.212>	Fearless of humid air and gathering rains
<cowper task 1.213>	Forth steps the man--an emblem of myself!
<cowper task 1.214>	More delicate his timorous mate retires.
<cowper task 1.215>	When Winter soaks the fields, and female feet,
<cowper task 1.216>	Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay,
<cowper task 1.217>	Or ford the rivulets, are best at home,
<cowper task 1.218>	The task of new discoveries falls on me.
<cowper task 1.219>	At such a season and with such a charge
<cowper task 1.220>	Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown,
<cowper task 1.221>	A cottage, whither oft we since repair:
<cowper task 1.222>	'Tis perched upon the green hill-top, but close
<cowper task 1.223>	Environed with a ring of branching elms
<cowper task 1.224>	That overhang the thatch, itself unseen
<cowper task 1.225>	Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset
<cowper task 1.226>	With foliage of such dark redundant growth,
<cowper task 1.227>	I called the low-roofed lodge the PEASANT'S NEST.
<cowper task 1.228>	And hidden as it is, and far remote
<cowper task 1.229>	From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear
<cowper task 1.230>	In village or in town, the bay of curs
<cowper task 1.231>	Incessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,
<cowper task 1.232>	And infants clamorous whether pleased or pained,
<cowper task 1.233>	Oft have I wished the peaceful covert mine.
<cowper task 1.234>	Here, I have said, at least I should possess
<cowper task 1.235>	The poet's treasure, silence, and indulge
<cowper task 1.236>	The dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.
<cowper task 1.237>	Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreat
<cowper task 1.238>	Dearly obtains the refuge it affords.
<cowper task 1.239>	Its elevated site forbids the wretch
<cowper task 1.240>	To drink sweet waters of the crystal well;
<cowper task 1.241>	He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,
<cowper task 1.242>	And heavy-laden brings his beverage home,
<cowper task 1.243>	Far-fetched and little worth:  nor seldom waits
<cowper task 1.244>	Dependent on the baker's punctual call,
<cowper task 1.245>	To hear his creaking panniers at the door,
<cowper task 1.246>	Angry and sad and his last crust consumed.
<cowper task 1.247>	So farewell envy of the PEASANT'S NEST.
<cowper task 1.248>	If solitude make scant the means of life,
<cowper task 1.249>	Society for me!  Thou seeming sweet,
<cowper task 1.250>	Be still a pleasing object in my view,
<cowper task 1.251>	My visit still, but never mine abode.
<cowper task 1.252>	Not distant far, a length of colonnade
<cowper task 1.253>	Invites us; monument of ancient taste,
<cowper task 1.254>	Now scorned, but worthy of a better fate.
<cowper task 1.255>	Our fathers knew the value of a screen
<cowper task 1.256>	From sultry suns, and, in their shaded walks
<cowper task 1.257>	And long-protracted bowers, enjoyed at noon
<cowper task 1.258>	The gloom and coolness of declining day.
<cowper task 1.259>	We bear our shades about us; self-deprived
<cowper task 1.260>	Of other screen, the thin umbrella spread,
<cowper task 1.261>	And range an Indian waste without a tree.
<cowper task 1.262>	Thanks to Benevolus--he spares me yet
<cowper task 1.263>	These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines,
<cowper task 1.264>	And, though himself so polished, still reprieves
<cowper task 1.265>	The obsolete prolixity of shade.
<cowper task 1.266>	Descending now (but cautious, lest too fast)
<cowper task 1.267>	A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge
<cowper task 1.268>	We pass a gulf, in which the willows dip
<cowper task 1.269>	Their pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.
<cowper task 1.270>	Hence ankle-deep in moss and flowery thyme
<cowper task 1.271>	We mount again, and feel at every step
<cowper task 1.272>	Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,
<cowper task 1.273>	Raised by the mole, the miner of the soil.
<cowper task 1.274>	He, not unlike the great ones of mankind,
<cowper task 1.275>	Disfigures earth, and plotting in the dark
<cowper task 1.276>	Toils much to earn a monumental pile,
<cowper task 1.277>	That may record the mischiefs he has done.
<cowper task 1.278>	The summit gained, behold the proud alcove
<cowper task 1.279>	That crowns it! yet not all its pride secures
<cowper task 1.280>	The grand retreat from injuries impressed
<cowper task 1.281>	By rural carvers, who with knives deface
<cowper task 1.282>	The panels, leaving an obscure rude name
<cowper task 1.283>	In characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.
<cowper task 1.284>	So strong the zeal to immortalise himself
<cowper task 1.285>	Beats in the breast of man, that even a few
<cowper task 1.286>	Few transient years, won from the abyss abhorred
<cowper task 1.287>	Of blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,
<cowper task 1.288>	And even to a clown.  Now roves the eye,
<cowper task 1.289>	And posted on this speculative height
<cowper task 1.290>	Exults in its command.  The sheepfold here
<cowper task 1.291>	Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe.
<cowper task 1.292>	At first, progressive as a stream, they seek
<cowper task 1.293>	The middle field; but scattered by degrees,
<cowper task 1.294>	Each to his choice, soon whiten all the land.
<cowper task 1.295>	There, from the sunburnt hay-field homeward creeps
<cowper task 1.296>	The loaded wain; while, lightened of its charge,
<cowper task 1.297>	The wain that meets it passes swiftly by,
<cowper task 1.298>	The boorish driver leaning o'er his team,
<cowper task 1.299>	Vociferous, and impatient of delay.
<cowper task 1.300>	Nor less attractive is the woodland scene
<cowper task 1.301>	Diversified with trees of every growth,
<cowper task 1.302>	Alike yet various.  Here the gray smooth trunks
<cowper task 1.303>	Of ash, or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,
<cowper task 1.304>	Within the twilight of their distant shades;
<cowper task 1.305>	There, lost behind a rising ground, the wood
<cowper task 1.306>	Seems sunk, and shortened to its topmost boughs.
<cowper task 1.307>	No tree in all the grove but has its charms,
<cowper task 1.308>	Though each its hue peculiar; paler some,
<cowper task 1.309>	And of a wannish gray; the willow such,
<cowper task 1.310>	And poplar that with silver lines his leaf,
<cowper task 1.311>	And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm;
<cowper task 1.312>	Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still,
<cowper task 1.313>	Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.
<cowper task 1.314>	Some glossy-leaved and shining in the sun,
<cowper task 1.315>	The maple, and the beech of oily nuts
<cowper task 1.316>	Prolific, and the lime at dewy eve
<cowper task 1.317>	Diffusing odours; nor unnoted pass
<cowper task 1.318>	The sycamore, capricious in attire,
<cowper task 1.319>	Now green, now tawny, and ere autumn yet
<cowper task 1.320>	Have changed the woods, in scarlet honours bright.
<cowper task 1.321>	O'er these, but far beyond (a spacious map
<cowper task 1.322>	Of hill and valley interposed between),
<cowper task 1.323>	The Ouse, dividing the well-watered land,
<cowper task 1.324>	Now glitters in the sun, and now retires,
<cowper task 1.325>	As bashful, yet impatient to be seen.
<cowper task 1.326>	Hence the declivity is sharp and short,
<cowper task 1.327>	And such the re-ascent; between them weeps
<cowper task 1.328>	A little Naiad her impoverished urn,
<cowper task 1.329>	All summer long, which winter fills again.
<cowper task 1.330>	The folded gates would bar my progress now,
<cowper task 1.331>	But that the lord of this enclosed demesne,
<cowper task 1.332>	Communicative of the good he owns,
<cowper task 1.333>	Admits me to a share:  the guiltless eye
<cowper task 1.334>	Commits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys.
<cowper task 1.335>	Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun?
<cowper task 1.336>	By short transition we have lost his glare,
<cowper task 1.337>	And stepped at once into a cooler clime.
<cowper task 1.338>	Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn
<cowper task 1.339>	Your fate unmerited, once more rejoice
<cowper task 1.340>	That yet a remnant of your race survives.
<cowper task 1.341>	How airy and how light the graceful arch,
<cowper task 1.342>	Yet awful as the consecrated roof
<cowper task 1.343>	Re-echoing pious anthems! while beneath,
<cowper task 1.344>	The chequered earth seems restless as a flood
<cowper task 1.345>	Brushed by the wind.  So sportive is the light
<cowper task 1.346>	Shot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,
<cowper task 1.347>	Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,
<cowper task 1.348>	And darkening and enlightening, as the leaves
<cowper task 1.349>	Play wanton, every moment, every spot.
<cowper task 1.350>	And now, with nerves new-braced and spirits cheered,
<cowper task 1.351>	We tread the wilderness, whose well-rolled walks,
<cowper task 1.352>	With curvature of slow and easy sweep--
<cowper task 1.353>	Deception innocent--give ample space
<cowper task 1.354>	To narrow bounds.  The grove receives us next;
<cowper task 1.355>	Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms
<cowper task 1.356>	We may discern the thresher at his task.
<cowper task 1.357>	Thump after thump resounds the constant flail,
<cowper task 1.358>	That seems to swing uncertain and yet falls
<cowper task 1.359>	Full on the destined ear.  Wide flies the chaff,
<cowper task 1.360>	The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist
<cowper task 1.361>	Of atoms, sparkling in the noonday beam.
<cowper task 1.362>	Come hither, ye that press your beds of down
<cowper task 1.363>	And sleep not:  see him sweating o'er his bread
<cowper task 1.364>	Before he eats it.--'Tis the primal curse,
<cowper task 1.365>	But softened into mercy; made the pledge
<cowper task 1.366>	Of cheerful days, and nights without a groan.
<cowper task 1.367>	By ceaseless action, all that is subsists.
<cowper task 1.368>	Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel
<cowper task 1.369>	That Nature rides upon, maintains her health,
<cowper task 1.370>	Her beauty, her fertility.  She dreads
<cowper task 1.371>	An instant's pause, and lives but while she moves.
<cowper task 1.372>	Its own revolvency upholds the world.
<cowper task 1.373>	Winds from all quarters agitate the air,
<cowper task 1.374>	And fit the limpid element for use,
<cowper task 1.375>	Else noxious:  oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams
<cowper task 1.376>	All feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed
<cowper task 1.377>	By restless undulation:  even the oak
<cowper task 1.378>	Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm:
<cowper task 1.379>	He seems indeed indignant, and to feel
<cowper task 1.380>	The impression of the blast with proud disdain,
<cowper task 1.381>	Frowning as if in his unconscious arm
<cowper task 1.382>	He held the thunder.  But the monarch owes
<cowper task 1.383>	His firm stability to what he scorns,
<cowper task 1.384>	More fixed below, the more disturbed above.
<cowper task 1.385>	The law, by which all creatures else are bound,
<cowper task 1.386>	Binds man the lord of all.  Himself derives
<cowper task 1.387>	No mean advantage from a kindred cause,
<cowper task 1.388>	From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease.
<cowper task 1.389>	The sedentary stretch their lazy length
<cowper task 1.390>	When custom bids, but no refreshment find,
<cowper task 1.391>	For none they need:  the languid eye, the cheek
<cowper task 1.392>	Deserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk,
<cowper task 1.393>	And withered muscle, and the vapid soul,
<cowper task 1.394>	Reproach their owner with that love of rest
<cowper task 1.395>	To which he forfeits even the rest he loves.
<cowper task 1.396>	Not such the alert and active.  Measure life
<cowper task 1.397>	By its true worth, the comforts it affords,
<cowper task 1.398>	And theirs alone seems worthy of the name
<cowper task 1.399>	Good health, and, its associate in the most,
<cowper task 1.400>	Good temper; spirits prompt to undertake,
<cowper task 1.401>	And not soon spent, though in an arduous task;
<cowper task 1.402>	The powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs;
<cowper task 1.403>	Even age itself seems privileged in them
<cowper task 1.404>	With clear exemption from its own defects.
<cowper task 1.405>	A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front
<cowper task 1.406>	The veteran shows, and gracing a gray beard
<cowper task 1.407>	With youthful smiles, descends towards the grave
<cowper task 1.408>	Sprightly, and old almost without decay.
<cowper task 1.409>	Like a coy maiden, Ease, when courted most,
<cowper task 1.410>	Farthest retires--an idol, at whose shrine
<cowper task 1.411>	Who oftenest sacrifice are favoured least.
<cowper task 1.412>	The love of Nature and the scene she draws
<cowper task 1.413>	Is Nature's dictate.  Strange, there should be found
<cowper task 1.414>	Who, self-imprisoned in their proud saloons,
<cowper task 1.415>	Renounce the odours of the open field
<cowper task 1.416>	For the unscented fictions of the loom;
<cowper task 1.417>	Who, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,
<cowper task 1.418>	Prefer to the performance of a God
<cowper task 1.419>	The inferior wonders of an artist's hand.
<cowper task 1.420>	Lovely indeed the mimic works of Art,
<cowper task 1.421>	But Nature's works far lovelier.  I admire,
<cowper task 1.422>	None more admires, the painter's magic skill,
<cowper task 1.423>	Who shows me that which I shall never see,
<cowper task 1.424>	Conveys a distant country into mine,
<cowper task 1.425>	And throws Italian light on English walls.
<cowper task 1.426>	But imitative strokes can do no more
<cowper task 1.427>	Than please the eye, sweet Nature every sense.
<cowper task 1.428>	The air salubrious of her lofty hills,
<cowper task 1.429>	The cheering fragrance of her dewy vales,
<cowper task 1.430>	And music of her woods--no works of man
<cowper task 1.431>	May rival these; these all bespeak a power
<cowper task 1.432>	Peculiar, and exclusively her own.
<cowper task 1.433>	Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast;
<cowper task 1.434>	'Tis free to all--'tis ev'ry day renewed,
<cowper task 1.435>	Who scorns it, starves deservedly at home.
<cowper task 1.436>	He does not scorn it, who, imprisoned long
<cowper task 1.437>	In some unwholesome dungeon, and a prey
<cowper task 1.438>	To sallow sickness, which the vapours dank
<cowper task 1.439>	And clammy of his dark abode have bred
<cowper task 1.440>	Escapes at last to liberty and light;
<cowper task 1.441>	His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue,
<cowper task 1.442>	His eye relumines its extinguished fires,
<cowper task 1.443>	He walks, he leaps, he runs--is winged with joy,
<cowper task 1.444>	And riots in the sweets of every breeze.
<cowper task 1.445>	He does not scorn it, who has long endured
<cowper task 1.446>	A fever's agonies, and fed on drugs.
<cowper task 1.447>	Nor yet the mariner, his blood inflamed
<cowper task 1.448>	With acrid salts; his very heart athirst
<cowper task 1.449>	To gaze at Nature in her green array.
<cowper task 1.450>	Upon the ship's tall side he stands, possessed
<cowper task 1.451>	With visions prompted by intense desire;
<cowper task 1.452>	Fair fields appear below, such as he left
<cowper task 1.453>	Far distant, such as he would die to find--
<cowper task 1.454>	He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.
<cowper task 1.455>	The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns;
<cowper task 1.456>	The lowering eye, the petulance, the frown,
<cowper task 1.457>	And sullen sadness that o'ershade, distort,
<cowper task 1.458>	And mar the face of beauty, when no cause
<cowper task 1.459>	For such immeasurable woe appears,
<cowper task 1.460>	These Flora banishes, and gives the fair
<cowper task 1.461>	Sweet smiles, and bloom less transient than her own.
<cowper task 1.462>	It is the constant revolution, stale
<cowper task 1.463>	And tasteless, of the same repeated joys
<cowper task 1.464>	That palls and satiates, and makes languid life
<cowper task 1.465>	A pedlar's pack that bows the bearer down.
<cowper task 1.466>	Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart
<cowper task 1.467>	Recoils from its own choice--at the full feast
<cowper task 1.468>	Is famished--finds no music in the song,
<cowper task 1.469>	No smartness in the jest, and wonders why.
<cowper task 1.470>	Yet thousands still desire to journey on,
<cowper task 1.471>	Though halt and weary of the path they tread.
<cowper task 1.472>	The paralytic, who can hold her cards
<cowper task 1.473>	But cannot play them, borrows a friend's hand
<cowper task 1.474>	To deal and shuffle, to divide and sort
<cowper task 1.475>	Her mingled suits and sequences, and sits
<cowper task 1.476>	Spectatress both and spectacle, a sad
<cowper task 1.477>	And silent cipher, while her proxy plays.
<cowper task 1.478>	Others are dragged into the crowded room
<cowper task 1.479>	Between supporters; and once seated, sit
<cowper task 1.480>	Through downright inability to rise,
<cowper task 1.481>	Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again.
<cowper task 1.482>	These speak a loud memento.  Yet even these
<cowper task 1.483>	Themselves love life, and cling to it as he,
<cowper task 1.484>	That overhangs a torrent, to a twig.
<cowper task 1.485>	They love it, and yet loathe it; fear to die,
<cowper task 1.486>	Yet scorn the purposes for which they live.
<cowper task 1.487>	Then wherefore not renounce them?  No--the dread,
<cowper task 1.488>	The slavish dread of solitude, that breeds
<cowper task 1.489>	Reflection and remorse, the fear of shame,
<cowper task 1.490>	And their inveterate habits, all forbid.
<cowper task 1.491>	Whom call we gay?  That honour has been long
<cowper task 1.492>	The boast of mere pretenders to the name.
<cowper task 1.493>	The innocent are gay--the lark is gay,
<cowper task 1.494>	That dries his feathers saturate with dew
<cowper task 1.495>	Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams
<cowper task 1.496>	Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest.
<cowper task 1.497>	The peasant too, a witness of his song,
<cowper task 1.498>	Himself a songster, is as gay as he.
<cowper task 1.499>	But save me from the gaiety of those
<cowper task 1.500>	Whose headaches nail them to a noonday bed;
<cowper task 1.501>	And save me, too, from theirs whose haggard eyes
<cowper task 1.502>	Flash desperation, and betray their pangs
<cowper task 1.503>	For property stripped off by cruel chance;
<cowper task 1.504>	From gaiety that fills the bones with pain,
<cowper task 1.505>	The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.
<cowper task 1.506>	The earth was made so various, that the mind
<cowper task 1.507>	Of desultory man, studious of change,
<cowper task 1.508>	And pleased with novelty, might be indulged.
<cowper task 1.509>	Prospects however lovely may be seen
<cowper task 1.510>	Till half their beauties fade; the weary sight,
<cowper task 1.511>	Too well acquainted with their smiles, slides off
<cowper task 1.512>	Fastidious, seeking less familiar scenes.
<cowper task 1.513>	Then snug enclosures in the sheltered vale,
<cowper task 1.514>	Where frequent hedges intercept the eye,
<cowper task 1.515>	Delight us, happy to renounce a while,
<cowper task 1.516>	Not senseless of its charms, what still we love,
<cowper task 1.517>	That such short absence may endear it more.
<cowper task 1.518>	Then forests, or the savage rock may please,
<cowper task 1.519>	That hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts
<cowper task 1.520>	Above the reach of man:  his hoary head
<cowper task 1.521>	Conspicuous many a league, the mariner,
<cowper task 1.522>	Bound homeward, and in hope already there,
<cowper task 1.523>	Greets with three cheers exulting.  At his waist
<cowper task 1.524>	A girdle of half-withered shrubs he shows,
<cowper task 1.525>	And at his feet the baffled billows die.
<cowper task 1.526>	The common overgrown with fern, and rough
<cowper task 1.527>	With prickly gorse, that, shapeless and deformed
<cowper task 1.528>	And dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom,
<cowper task 1.529>	And decks itself with ornaments of gold,
<cowper task 1.530>	Yields no unpleasing ramble; there the turf
<cowper task 1.531>	Smells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs
<cowper task 1.532>	And fungous fruits of earth, regales the sense
<cowper task 1.533>	With luxury of unexpected sweets.
<cowper task 1.534>	There often wanders one, whom better days
<cowper task 1.535>	Saw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed
<cowper task 1.536>	With lace, and hat with splendid ribbon bound.
<cowper task 1.537>	A serving-maid was she, and fell in love
<cowper task 1.538>	With one who left her, went to sea and died.
<cowper task 1.539>	Her fancy followed him through foaming waves
<cowper task 1.540>	To distant shores, and she would sit and weep
<cowper task 1.541>	At what a sailor suffers; fancy too,
<cowper task 1.542>	Delusive most where warmest wishes are,
<cowper task 1.543>	Would oft anticipate his glad return,
<cowper task 1.544>	And dream of transports she was not to know.
<cowper task 1.545>	She heard the doleful tidings of his death,
<cowper task 1.546>	And never smiled again.  And now she roams
<cowper task 1.547>	The dreary waste; there spends the livelong day,
<cowper task 1.548>	And there, unless when charity forbids,
<cowper task 1.549>	The livelong night.  A tattered apron hides,
<cowper task 1.550>	Worn as a cloak, and hardly hides, a gown
<cowper task 1.551>	More tattered still; and both but ill conceal
<cowper task 1.552>	A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.
<cowper task 1.553>	She begs an idle pin of all she meets,
<cowper task 1.554>	And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,
<cowper task 1.555>	Though pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,
<cowper task 1.556>	Though pinched with cold, asks never.--Kate is crazed!
<cowper task 1.557>	I see a column of slow-rising smoke
<cowper task 1.558>	O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.
<cowper task 1.559>	A vagabond and useless tribe there eat
<cowper task 1.560>	Their miserable meal.  A kettle slung
<cowper task 1.561>	Between two poles upon a stick transverse,
<cowper task 1.562>	Receives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog,
<cowper task 1.563>	Or vermin, or, at best, of cock purloined
<cowper task 1.564>	From his accustomed perch.  Hard-faring race!
<cowper task 1.565>	They pick their fuel out of every hedge,
<cowper task 1.566>	Which, kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquenched
<cowper task 1.567>	The spark of life.  The sportive wind blows wide
<cowper task 1.568>	Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin,
<cowper task 1.569>	The vellum of the pedigree they claim.
<cowper task 1.570>	Great skill have they in palmistry, and more
<cowper task 1.571>	To conjure clean away the gold they touch,
<cowper task 1.572>	Conveying worthless dross into its place;
<cowper task 1.573>	Loud when they beg, dumb only when they steal.
<cowper task 1.574>	Strange! that a creature rational, and cast
<cowper task 1.575>	In human mould, should brutalise by choice
<cowper task 1.576>	His nature, and, though capable of arts
<cowper task 1.577>	By which the world might profit and himself,
<cowper task 1.578>	Self-banished from society, prefer
<cowper task 1.579>	Such squalid sloth to honourable toil.
<cowper task 1.580>	Yet even these, though feigning sickness oft
<cowper task 1.581>	They swathe the forehead, drag the limping limb,
<cowper task 1.582>	And vex their flesh with artificial sores,
<cowper task 1.583>	Can change their whine into a mirthful note
<cowper task 1.584>	When safe occasion offers, and with dance,
<cowper task 1.585>	And music of the bladder and the bag,
<cowper task 1.586>	Beguile their woes, and make the woods resound.
<cowper task 1.587>	Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy
<cowper task 1.588>	The houseless rovers of the sylvan world;
<cowper task 1.589>	And breathing wholesome air, and wandering much,
<cowper task 1.590>	Need other physic none to heal the effects
<cowper task 1.591>	Of loathsome diet, penury, and cold.
<cowper task 1.592>	Blest he, though undistinguished from the crowd
<cowper task 1.593>	By wealth or dignity, who dwells secure
<cowper task 1.594>	Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside
<cowper task 1.595>	His fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn
<cowper task 1.596>	The manners and the arts of civil life.
<cowper task 1.597>	His wants, indeed, are many; but supply
<cowper task 1.598>	Is obvious; placed within the easy reach
<cowper task 1.599>	Of temperate wishes and industrious hands.
<cowper task 1.600>	Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil;
<cowper task 1.601>	Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns,
<cowper task 1.602>	And terrible to sight, as when she springs
<cowper task 1.603>	(If e'er she spring spontaneous) in remote
<cowper task 1.604>	And barbarous climes, where violence prevails,
<cowper task 1.605>	And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,
<cowper task 1.606>	By culture tamed, by liberty refreshed,
<cowper task 1.607>	And all her fruits by radiant truth matured.
<cowper task 1.608>	War and the chase engross the savage whole;
<cowper task 1.609>	War followed for revenge, or to supplant
<cowper task 1.610>	The envied tenants of some happier spot;
<cowper task 1.611>	The chase for sustenance, precarious trust!
<cowper task 1.612>	His hard condition with severe constraint
<cowper task 1.613>	Binds all his faculties, forbids all growth
<cowper task 1.614>	Of wisdom, proves a school in which he learns
<cowper task 1.615>	Sly circumvention, unrelenting hate,
<cowper task 1.616>	Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside.
<cowper task 1.617>	Thus fare the shivering natives of the north,
<cowper task 1.618>	And thus the rangers of the western world,
<cowper task 1.619>	Where it advances far into the deep,
<cowper task 1.620>	Towards the Antarctic.  Even the favoured isles
<cowper task 1.621>	So lately found, although the constant sun
<cowper task 1.622>	Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,
<cowper task 1.623>	Can boast but little virtue; and inert
<cowper task 1.624>	Through plenty, lose in morals what they gain
<cowper task 1.625>	In manners, victims of luxurious ease.
<cowper task 1.626>	These therefore I can pity, placed remote
<cowper task 1.627>	From all that science traces, art invents,
<cowper task 1.628>	Or inspiration teaches; and enclosed
<cowper task 1.629>	In boundless oceans, never to be passed
<cowper task 1.630>	By navigators uninformed as they,
<cowper task 1.631>	Or ploughed perhaps by British bark again.
<cowper task 1.632>	But far beyond the rest, and with most cause,
<cowper task 1.633>	Thee, gentle savage! whom no love of thee
<cowper task 1.634>	Or thine, but curiosity perhaps,
<cowper task 1.635>	Or else vain-glory, prompted us to draw
<cowper task 1.636>	Forth from thy native bowers, to show thee here
<cowper task 1.637>	With what superior skill we can abuse
<cowper task 1.638>	The gifts of Providence, and squander life.
<cowper task 1.639>	The dream is past.  And thou hast found again
<cowper task 1.640>	Thy cocoas and bananas, palms, and yams,
<cowper task 1.641>	And homestall thatched with leaves.  But hast thou found
<cowper task 1.642>	Their former charms?  And, having seen our state,
<cowper task 1.643>	Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp
<cowper task 1.644>	Of equipage, our gardens, and our sports,
<cowper task 1.645>	And heard our music; are thy simple friends,
<cowper task 1.646>	Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights
<cowper task 1.647>	As dear to thee as once?  And have thy joys
<cowper task 1.648>	Lost nothing by comparison with ours?
<cowper task 1.649>	Rude as thou art (for we returned thee rude
<cowper task 1.650>	And ignorant, except of outward show),
<cowper task 1.651>	I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart
<cowper task 1.652>	And spiritless, as never to regret
<cowper task 1.653>	Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.
<cowper task 1.654>	Methinks I see thee straying on the beach,
<cowper task 1.655>	And asking of the surge that bathes the foot
<cowper task 1.656>	If ever it has washed our distant shore.
<cowper task 1.657>	I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,
<cowper task 1.658>	A patriot's for his country.  Thou art sad
<cowper task 1.659>	At thought of her forlorn and abject state,
<cowper task 1.660>	From which no power of thine can raise her up.
<cowper task 1.661>	Thus fancy paints thee, and, though apt to err,
<cowper task 1.662>	Perhaps errs little when she paints thee thus.
<cowper task 1.663>	She tells me too that duly every morn
<cowper task 1.664>	Thou climb'st the mountain-top, with eager eye
<cowper task 1.665>	Exploring far and wide the watery waste,
<cowper task 1.666>	For sight of ship from England.  Every speck
<cowper task 1.667>	Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale
<cowper task 1.668>	With conflict of contending hopes and fears.
<cowper task 1.669>	But comes at last the dull and dusky eve,
<cowper task 1.670>	And sends thee to thy cabin, well prepared
<cowper task 1.671>	To dream all night of what the day denied.
<cowper task 1.672>	Alas, expect it not.  We found no bait
<cowper task 1.673>	To tempt us in thy country.  Doing good,
<cowper task 1.674>	Disinterested good, is not our trade.
<cowper task 1.675>	We travel far, 'tis true, but not for naught;
<cowper task 1.676>	And must be bribed to compass earth again
<cowper task 1.677>	By other hopes, and richer fruits than yours.
<cowper task 1.678>	But though true worth and virtue, in the mild
<cowper task 1.679>	And genial soil of cultivated life
<cowper task 1.680>	Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,
<cowper task 1.681>	Yet not in cities oft.  In proud and gay
<cowper task 1.682>	And gain-devoted cities, thither flow,
<cowper task 1.683>	As to a common and most noisome sewer,
<cowper task 1.684>	The dregs and feculence of every land.
<cowper task 1.685>	In cities, foul example on most minds
<cowper task 1.686>	Begets its likeness.  Rank abundance breeds
<cowper task 1.687>	In gross and pampered cities sloth and lust,
<cowper task 1.688>	And wantonness and gluttonous excess.
<cowper task 1.689>	In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,
<cowper task 1.690>	Or seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught
<cowper task 1.691>	By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there,
<cowper task 1.692>	Beyond the achievement of successful flight.
<cowper task 1.693>	I do confess them nurseries of the arts,
<cowper task 1.694>	In which they flourish most; where, in the beams
<cowper task 1.695>	Of warm encouragement, and in the eye
<cowper task 1.696>	Of public note, they reach their perfect size.
<cowper task 1.697>	Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaimed
<cowper task 1.698>	The fairest capital in all the world,
<cowper task 1.699>	By riot and incontinence the worst.
<cowper task 1.700>	There, touched by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes
<cowper task 1.701>	A lucid mirror, in which nature sees
<cowper task 1.702>	All her reflected features.  Bacon there
<cowper task 1.703>	Gives more than female beauty to a stone,
<cowper task 1.704>	And Chatham's eloquence to marble lips.
<cowper task 1.705>	Nor does the chisel occupy alone
<cowper task 1.706>	The powers of sculpture, but the style as much;
<cowper task 1.707>	Each province of her art her equal care.
<cowper task 1.708>	With nice incision of her guided steel
<cowper task 1.709>	She ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soil
<cowper task 1.710>	So sterile with what charms soe'er she will,
<cowper task 1.711>	The richest scenery and the loveliest forms.
<cowper task 1.712>	Where finds philosophy her eagle eye,
<cowper task 1.713>	With which she gazes at yon burning disk
<cowper task 1.714>	Undazzled, and detects and counts his spots?
<cowper task 1.715>	In London.  Where her implements exact,
<cowper task 1.716>	With which she calculates, computes, and scans
<cowper task 1.717>	All distance, motion, magnitude, and now
<cowper task 1.718>	Measures an atom, and now girds a world?
<cowper task 1.719>	In London.  Where has commerce such a mart,
<cowper task 1.720>	So rich, so thronged, so drained, and so supplied,
<cowper task 1.721>	As London, opulent, enlarged, and still
<cowper task 1.722>	Increasing London?  Babylon of old
<cowper task 1.723>	Not more the glory of the earth, than she
<cowper task 1.724>	A more accomplished world's chief glory now.
<cowper task 1.725>	She has her praise.  Now mark a spot or two
<cowper task 1.726>	That so much beauty would do well to purge;
<cowper task 1.727>	And show this queen of cities, that so fair
<cowper task 1.728>	May yet be foul; so witty, yet not wise.
<cowper task 1.729>	It is not seemly, nor of good report,
<cowper task 1.730>	That she is slack in discipline; more prompt
<cowper task 1.731>	To avenge than to prevent the breach of law:
<cowper task 1.732>	That she is rigid in denouncing death
<cowper task 1.733>	On petty robbers, and indulges life
<cowper task 1.734>	And liberty, and ofttimes honour too,
<cowper task 1.735>	To peculators of the public gold:
<cowper task 1.736>	That thieves at home must hang; but he, that puts
<cowper task 1.737>	Into his overgorged and bloated purse
<cowper task 1.738>	The wealth of Indian provinces, escapes.
<cowper task 1.739>	Nor is it well, nor can it come to good,
<cowper task 1.740>	That through profane and infidel contempt
<cowper task 1.741>	Of holy writ, she has presumed to annul
<cowper task 1.742>	And abrogate, as roundly as she may,
<cowper task 1.743>	The total ordinance and will of God;
<cowper task 1.744>	Advancing fashion to the post of truth,
<cowper task 1.745>	And centring all authority in modes
<cowper task 1.746>	And customs of her own, till Sabbath rites
<cowper task 1.747>	Have dwindled into unrespected forms,
<cowper task 1.748>	And knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced.
<cowper task 1.749>	God made the country, and man made the town.
<cowper task 1.750>	What wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts
<cowper task 1.751>	That can alone make sweet the bitter draught
<cowper task 1.752>	That life holds out to all, should most abound
<cowper task 1.753>	And least be threatened in the fields and groves?
<cowper task 1.754>	Possess ye therefore, ye who, borne about
<cowper task 1.755>	In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue
<cowper task 1.756>	But that of idleness, and taste no scenes
<cowper task 1.757>	But such as art contrives, possess ye still
<cowper task 1.758>	Your element; there only ye can shine,
<cowper task 1.759>	There only minds like yours can do no harm.
<cowper task 1.760>	Our groves were planted to console at noon
<cowper task 1.761>	The pensive wanderer in their shades.  At eve
<cowper task 1.762>	The moonbeam, sliding softly in between
<cowper task 1.763>	The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,
<cowper task 1.764>	Birds warbling all the music.  We can spare
<cowper task 1.765>	The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse
<cowper task 1.766>	Our softer satellite.  Your songs confound
<cowper task 1.767>	Our more harmonious notes.  The thrush departs
<cowper task 1.768>	Scared, and the offended nightingale is mute.
<cowper task 1.769>	There is a public mischief in your mirth;
<cowper task 1.770>	It plagues your country.  Folly such as yours,
<cowper task 1.771>	Graced with a sword, and worthier of a fan,
<cowper task 1.772>	Has made, which enemies could ne'er have done,
<cowper task 1.773>	Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you,
<cowper task 1.774>	A mutilated structure, soon to fall.
