<wordsworth prelude 1.1>	O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,
<wordsworth prelude 1.2>	A visitant that while it fans my cheek
<wordsworth prelude 1.3>	Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings
<wordsworth prelude 1.4>	From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.
<wordsworth prelude 1.5>	Whate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come
<wordsworth prelude 1.6>	To none more grateful than to me; escaped
<wordsworth prelude 1.7>	From the vast city, where I long had pined
<wordsworth prelude 1.8>	A discontented sojourner: now free,
<wordsworth prelude 1.9>	Free as a bird to settle where I will.
<wordsworth prelude 1.10>	What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale
<wordsworth prelude 1.11>	Shall be my harbour? underneath what grove
<wordsworth prelude 1.12>	Shall I take up my home? and what clear stream
<wordsworth prelude 1.13>	Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?
<wordsworth prelude 1.14>	The earth is all before me. With a heart
<wordsworth prelude 1.15>	Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,
<wordsworth prelude 1.16>	I look about; and should the chosen guide
<wordsworth prelude 1.17>	Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,
<wordsworth prelude 1.18>	I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!
<wordsworth prelude 1.19>	Trances of thought and mountings of the mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.20>	Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,
<wordsworth prelude 1.21>	That burthen of my own unnatural self,
<wordsworth prelude 1.22>	The heavy weight of many a weary day
<wordsworth prelude 1.23>	Not mine, and such as were not made for me.
<wordsworth prelude 1.24>	Long months of peace (if such bold word accord
<wordsworth prelude 1.25>	With any promises of human life),
<wordsworth prelude 1.26>	Long months of ease and undisturbed delight
<wordsworth prelude 1.27>	Are mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.28>	By road or pathway, or through trackless field,
<wordsworth prelude 1.29>	Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing
<wordsworth prelude 1.30>	Upon the river point me out my course?
<wordsworth prelude 1.31>	Dear Liberty! Yet what would it avail
<wordsworth prelude 1.32>	But for a gift that consecrates the joy?
<wordsworth prelude 1.33>	For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven
<wordsworth prelude 1.34>	Was blowing on my body, felt within
<wordsworth prelude 1.35>	A correspondent breeze, that gently moved
<wordsworth prelude 1.36>	With quickening virtue, but is now become
<wordsworth prelude 1.37>	A tempest, a redundant energy,
<wordsworth prelude 1.38>	Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,
<wordsworth prelude 1.39>	And their congenial powers, that, while they join
<wordsworth prelude 1.40>	In breaking up a long-continued frost,
<wordsworth prelude 1.41>	Bring with them vernal promises, the hope
<wordsworth prelude 1.42>	Of active days urged on by flying hours,—
<wordsworth prelude 1.43>	Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought
<wordsworth prelude 1.44>	Abstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,
<wordsworth prelude 1.45>	Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!
<wordsworth prelude 1.46>	Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make
<wordsworth prelude 1.47>	A present joy the matter of a song,
<wordsworth prelude 1.48>	Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains
<wordsworth prelude 1.49>	That would not be forgotten, and are here
<wordsworth prelude 1.50>	Recorded: to the open fields I told
<wordsworth prelude 1.51>	A prophecy: poetic numbers came
<wordsworth prelude 1.52>	Spontaneously to clothe in priestly robe
<wordsworth prelude 1.53>	A renovated spirit singled out,
<wordsworth prelude 1.54>	Such hope was mine, for holy services.
<wordsworth prelude 1.55>	My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's
<wordsworth prelude 1.56>	Internal echo of the imperfect sound;
<wordsworth prelude 1.57>	To both I listened, drawing from them both
<wordsworth prelude 1.58>	A cheerful confidence in things to come.
<wordsworth prelude 1.59>	Content and not unwilling now to give
<wordsworth prelude 1.60>	A respite to this passion, I paced on
<wordsworth prelude 1.61>	With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,
<wordsworth prelude 1.62>	To a green shady place, where down I sate
<wordsworth prelude 1.63>	Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,
<wordsworth prelude 1.64>	And settling into gentler happiness.
<wordsworth prelude 1.65>	'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,
<wordsworth prelude 1.66>	With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.67>	Two hours declined towards the west; a day
<wordsworth prelude 1.68>	With silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,
<wordsworth prelude 1.69>	And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove
<wordsworth prelude 1.70>	A perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.71>	Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was made
<wordsworth prelude 1.72>	Of a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.73>	Nor rest till they had reached the very door
<wordsworth prelude 1.74>	Of the one cottage which methought I saw.
<wordsworth prelude 1.75>	No picture of mere memory ever looked
<wordsworth prelude 1.76>	So fair; and while upon the fancied scene
<wordsworth prelude 1.77>	I gazed with growing love, a higher power
<wordsworth prelude 1.78>	Than Fancy gave assurance of some work
<wordsworth prelude 1.79>	Of glory there forthwith to be begun,
<wordsworth prelude 1.80>	Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,
<wordsworth prelude 1.81>	Nor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.82>	Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.83>	Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup
<wordsworth prelude 1.84>	Dislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once
<wordsworth prelude 1.85>	To the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.
<wordsworth prelude 1.86>	From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.87>	Had almost touched the horizon; casting then
<wordsworth prelude 1.88>	A backward glance upon the curling cloud
<wordsworth prelude 1.89>	Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;
<wordsworth prelude 1.90>	Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,
<wordsworth prelude 1.91>	But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,
<wordsworth prelude 1.92>	Even with the chance equipment of that hour,
<wordsworth prelude 1.93>	The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.
<wordsworth prelude 1.94>	It was a splendid evening, and my soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.95>	Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked
<wordsworth prelude 1.96>	Æolian visitations; but the harp
<wordsworth prelude 1.97>	Was soon defrauded, and the banded host
<wordsworth prelude 1.98>	Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,
<wordsworth prelude 1.99>	And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;
<wordsworth prelude 1.100>	Why think of any thing but present good?"
<wordsworth prelude 1.101>	So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued
<wordsworth prelude 1.102>	My way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed
<wordsworth prelude 1.103>	Mild influence; nor left in me one wish
<wordsworth prelude 1.104>	Again to bend the Sabbath of that time
<wordsworth prelude 1.105>	To a servile yoke. What need of many words?
<wordsworth prelude 1.106>	A pleasant loitering journey, through three days
<wordsworth prelude 1.107>	Continued, brought me to my hermitage,
<wordsworth prelude 1.108>	I spare to tell of what ensued, the life
<wordsworth prelude 1.109>	In common things—the endless store of things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.110>	Rare, or at least so seeming, every day
<wordsworth prelude 1.111>	Found all about me in one neighbourhood—
<wordsworth prelude 1.112>	The self-congratulation, and, from morn
<wordsworth prelude 1.113>	To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.
<wordsworth prelude 1.114>	But speedily an earnest longing rose
<wordsworth prelude 1.115>	To brace myself to some determined aim,
<wordsworth prelude 1.116>	Reading or thinking; either to lay up
<wordsworth prelude 1.117>	New stores, or rescue from decay the old
<wordsworth prelude 1.118>	By timely interference: and therewith
<wordsworth prelude 1.119>	Came hopes still higher, that with outward life
<wordsworth prelude 1.120>	I might endue some airy phantasies
<wordsworth prelude 1.121>	That had been floating loose about for years,
<wordsworth prelude 1.122>	And to such beings temperately deal forth
<wordsworth prelude 1.123>	The many feelings that oppressed my heart.
<wordsworth prelude 1.124>	That hope hath been discouraged; welcome light
<wordsworth prelude 1.125>	Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear
<wordsworth prelude 1.126>	And mock me with a sky that ripens not
<wordsworth prelude 1.127>	Into a steady morning: if my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.128>	Remembering the bold promise of the past,
<wordsworth prelude 1.129>	Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,
<wordsworth prelude 1.130>	Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds
<wordsworth prelude 1.131>	Impediments from day to day renewed.
<wordsworth prelude 1.132>	And now it would content me to yield up
<wordsworth prelude 1.133>	Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts
<wordsworth prelude 1.134>	Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!
<wordsworth prelude 1.135>	The Poet, gentle creature as he is,
<wordsworth prelude 1.136>	Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;
<wordsworth prelude 1.137>	His fits when he is neither sick nor well,
<wordsworth prelude 1.138>	Though no distress be near him but his own
<wordsworth prelude 1.139>	Unmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased
<wordsworth prelude 1.140>	While she as duteous as the mother dove
<wordsworth prelude 1.141>	Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,
<wordsworth prelude 1.142>	But like the innocent bird, hath goadings on
<wordsworth prelude 1.143>	That drive her as in trouble through the groves;
<wordsworth prelude 1.144>	With me is now such passion, to be blamed
<wordsworth prelude 1.145>	No otherwise than as it lasts too long.
<wordsworth prelude 1.146>	When, as becomes a man who would prepare
<wordsworth prelude 1.147>	For such an arduous work, I through myself
<wordsworth prelude 1.148>	Make rigorous inquisition, the report
<wordsworth prelude 1.149>	Is often cheering; for I neither seem
<wordsworth prelude 1.150>	To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,
<wordsworth prelude 1.151>	Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort
<wordsworth prelude 1.152>	Of Elements and Agents, Under-powers,
<wordsworth prelude 1.153>	Subordinate helpers of the living mind:
<wordsworth prelude 1.154>	Nor am I naked of external things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.155>	Forms, images, nor numerous other aids
<wordsworth prelude 1.156>	Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil
<wordsworth prelude 1.157>	And needful to build up a Poet's praise.
<wordsworth prelude 1.158>	Time, place, and manners do I seek, and these
<wordsworth prelude 1.159>	Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such
<wordsworth prelude 1.160>	As may be singled out with steady choice;
<wordsworth prelude 1.161>	No little band of yet remembered names
<wordsworth prelude 1.162>	Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope
<wordsworth prelude 1.163>	To summon back from lonesome banishment,
<wordsworth prelude 1.164>	And make them dwellers in the hearts of men
<wordsworth prelude 1.165>	Now living, or to live in future years.
<wordsworth prelude 1.166>	Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking
<wordsworth prelude 1.167>	Proud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,
<wordsworth prelude 1.168>	Will settle on some British theme, some old
<wordsworth prelude 1.169>	Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;
<wordsworth prelude 1.170>	More often turning to some gentle place
<wordsworth prelude 1.171>	Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipe
<wordsworth prelude 1.172>	To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,
<wordsworth prelude 1.173>	Amid reposing knights by a river side
<wordsworth prelude 1.174>	Or fountain, listen to the grave reports
<wordsworth prelude 1.175>	Of dire enchantments faced and overcome
<wordsworth prelude 1.176>	By the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,
<wordsworth prelude 1.177>	Where spear encountered spear, and sword with sword
<wordsworth prelude 1.178>	Fought, as if conscious of the blazonry
<wordsworth prelude 1.179>	That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;
<wordsworth prelude 1.180>	Whence inspiration for a song that winds
<wordsworth prelude 1.181>	Through ever changing scenes of votive quest
<wordsworth prelude 1.182>	Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid
<wordsworth prelude 1.183>	To patient courage and unblemished truth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.184>	To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,
<wordsworth prelude 1.185>	And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.
<wordsworth prelude 1.186>	Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate
<wordsworth prelude 1.187>	How vanquished Mithridates northward passed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.188>	And, hidden in the cloud of years, became
<wordsworth prelude 1.189>	Odin, the Father of a race by whom
<wordsworth prelude 1.190>	Perished the Roman Empire: how the friends
<wordsworth prelude 1.191>	And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain
<wordsworth prelude 1.192>	Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,
<wordsworth prelude 1.193>	And left their usages, their arts and laws,
<wordsworth prelude 1.194>	To disappear by a slow gradual death,
<wordsworth prelude 1.195>	To dwindle and to perish one by one,
<wordsworth prelude 1.196>	Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.197>	Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred years
<wordsworth prelude 1.198>	Survived, and, when the European came
<wordsworth prelude 1.199>	With skill and power that might not be withstood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.200>	Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold
<wordsworth prelude 1.201>	And wasted down by glorious death that race
<wordsworth prelude 1.202>	Of natural heroes: or I would record
<wordsworth prelude 1.203>	How, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,
<wordsworth prelude 1.204>	Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,
<wordsworth prelude 1.205>	Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,
<wordsworth prelude 1.206>	How that one Frenchman, through continued force
<wordsworth prelude 1.207>	Of meditation on the inhuman deeds
<wordsworth prelude 1.208>	Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,
<wordsworth prelude 1.209>	Went single in his ministry across
<wordsworth prelude 1.210>	The Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.211>	But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about
<wordsworth prelude 1.212>	Withering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought
<wordsworth prelude 1.213>	Help at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:
<wordsworth prelude 1.214>	How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name
<wordsworth prelude 1.215>	Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,
<wordsworth prelude 1.216>	All over his dear Country; left the deeds
<wordsworth prelude 1.217>	Of Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,
<wordsworth prelude 1.218>	To people the steep rocks and river banks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.219>	Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soul
<wordsworth prelude 1.220>	Of independence and stern liberty.
<wordsworth prelude 1.221>	Sometimes it suits me better to invent
<wordsworth prelude 1.222>	A tale from my own heart, more near akin
<wordsworth prelude 1.223>	To my own passions and habitual thoughts;
<wordsworth prelude 1.224>	Some variegated story, in the main
<wordsworth prelude 1.225>	Lofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts
<wordsworth prelude 1.226>	Before the very sun that brightens it,
<wordsworth prelude 1.227>	Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,
<wordsworth prelude 1.228>	My best and favourite aspiration, mounts
<wordsworth prelude 1.229>	With yearning toward some philosophic song
<wordsworth prelude 1.230>	Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;
<wordsworth prelude 1.231>	With meditations passionate from deep
<wordsworth prelude 1.232>	Recesses in man's heart, immortal verse
<wordsworth prelude 1.233>	Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;
<wordsworth prelude 1.234>	But from this awful burthen I full soon
<wordsworth prelude 1.235>	Take refuge and beguile myself with trust
<wordsworth prelude 1.236>	That mellower years will bring a riper mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.237>	And clearer insight. Thus my days are past
<wordsworth prelude 1.238>	In contradiction; with no skill to part
<wordsworth prelude 1.239>	Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,
<wordsworth prelude 1.240>	From paramount impulse not to be withstood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.241>	A timorous capacity from prudence,
<wordsworth prelude 1.242>	From circumspection, infinite delay.
<wordsworth prelude 1.243>	Humility and modest awe themselves
<wordsworth prelude 1.244>	Betray me, serving often for a cloak
<wordsworth prelude 1.245>	To a more subtle selfishness; that now
<wordsworth prelude 1.246>	Locks every function up in blank reserve,
<wordsworth prelude 1.247>	Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye
<wordsworth prelude 1.248>	That with intrusive restlessness beats off
<wordsworth prelude 1.249>	Simplicity and self-presented truth.
<wordsworth prelude 1.250>	Ah! better far than this, to stray about
<wordsworth prelude 1.251>	Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,
<wordsworth prelude 1.252>	And ask no record of the hours, resigned
<wordsworth prelude 1.253>	To vacant musing, unreproved neglect
<wordsworth prelude 1.254>	Of all things, and deliberate holiday.
<wordsworth prelude 1.255>	Far better never to have heard the name
<wordsworth prelude 1.256>	Of zeal and just ambition, than to live
<wordsworth prelude 1.257>	Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour
<wordsworth prelude 1.258>	Turns recreant to her task; takes heart again,
<wordsworth prelude 1.259>	Then feels immediately some hollow thought
<wordsworth prelude 1.260>	Hang like an interdict upon her hopes.
<wordsworth prelude 1.261>	This is my lot; for either still I find
<wordsworth prelude 1.262>	Some imperfection in the chosen theme,
<wordsworth prelude 1.263>	Or see of absolute accomplishment
<wordsworth prelude 1.264>	Much wanting, so much wanting, in myself,
<wordsworth prelude 1.265>	That I recoil and droop, and seek repose
<wordsworth prelude 1.266>	In listlessness from vain perplexity,
<wordsworth prelude 1.267>	Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,
<wordsworth prelude 1.268>	Like a false steward who hath much received
<wordsworth prelude 1.269>	And renders nothing back.
<wordsworth prelude 1.270>	Was it for this
<wordsworth prelude 1.271>	That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved
<wordsworth prelude 1.272>	To blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,
<wordsworth prelude 1.273>	And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,
<wordsworth prelude 1.274>	And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.275>	That flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,
<wordsworth prelude 1.276>	O Derwent! winding among grassy holms
<wordsworth prelude 1.277>	Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,
<wordsworth prelude 1.278>	Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.279>	To more than infant softness, giving me
<wordsworth prelude 1.280>	Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind
<wordsworth prelude 1.281>	A foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm
<wordsworth prelude 1.282>	That Nature breathes among the hills and groves?
<wordsworth prelude 1.283>	When he had left the mountains and received
<wordsworth prelude 1.284>	On his smooth breast the shadow of those towers
<wordsworth prelude 1.285>	That yet survive, a shattered monument
<wordsworth prelude 1.286>	Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed
<wordsworth prelude 1.287>	Along the margin of our terrace walk;
<wordsworth prelude 1.288>	A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.
<wordsworth prelude 1.289>	Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,
<wordsworth prelude 1.290>	In a small mill-race severed from his stream,
<wordsworth prelude 1.291>	Made one long bathing of a summer's day;
<wordsworth prelude 1.292>	Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked again
<wordsworth prelude 1.293>	Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured
<wordsworth prelude 1.294>	The sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves
<wordsworth prelude 1.295>	Of yellow ragwort; or when rock and hill,
<wordsworth prelude 1.296>	The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,
<wordsworth prelude 1.297>	Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone
<wordsworth prelude 1.298>	Beneath the sky, as if I had been born
<wordsworth prelude 1.299>	On Indian plains, and from my mother's hut
<wordsworth prelude 1.300>	Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport
<wordsworth prelude 1.301>	A naked savage, in the thunder shower.
<wordsworth prelude 1.302>	Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up
<wordsworth prelude 1.303>	Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:
<wordsworth prelude 1.304>	Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less
<wordsworth prelude 1.305>	In that beloved Vale to which erelong
<wordsworth prelude 1.306>	We were transplanted—there were we let loose
<wordsworth prelude 1.307>	For sports of wider range. Ere I had told
<wordsworth prelude 1.308>	Ten birth-days, when among the mountain slopes
<wordsworth prelude 1.309>	Frost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped
<wordsworth prelude 1.310>	The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.311>	With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung
<wordsworth prelude 1.312>	To range the open heights where woodcocks run
<wordsworth prelude 1.313>	Along the smooth green turf. Through half the night,
<wordsworth prelude 1.314>	Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied
<wordsworth prelude 1.315>	That anxious visitation;—moon and stars
<wordsworth prelude 1.316>	Were shining o'er my head. I was alone,
<wordsworth prelude 1.317>	And seemed to be a trouble to the peace
<wordsworth prelude 1.318>	That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel
<wordsworth prelude 1.319>	In these night wanderings, that a strong desire
<wordsworth prelude 1.320>	O'erpowered my better reason, and the bird
<wordsworth prelude 1.321>	Which was the captive of another's toil
<wordsworth prelude 1.322>	Became my prey; and when the deed was done
<wordsworth prelude 1.323>	I heard among the solitary hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.324>	Low breathings coming after me, and sounds
<wordsworth prelude 1.325>	Of undistinguishable motion, steps
<wordsworth prelude 1.326>	Almost as silent as the turf they trod.
<wordsworth prelude 1.327>	Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,
<wordsworth prelude 1.328>	Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird
<wordsworth prelude 1.329>	Had in high places built her lodge; though mean
<wordsworth prelude 1.330>	Our object and inglorious, yet the end
<wordsworth prelude 1.331>	Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung
<wordsworth prelude 1.332>	Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass
<wordsworth prelude 1.333>	And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock
<wordsworth prelude 1.334>	But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)
<wordsworth prelude 1.335>	Suspended by the blast that blew amain,
<wordsworth prelude 1.336>	Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time
<wordsworth prelude 1.337>	While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,
<wordsworth prelude 1.338>	With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind
<wordsworth prelude 1.339>	Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky
<wordsworth prelude 1.340>	Of earth—and with what motion moved the clouds!
<wordsworth prelude 1.341>	Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows
<wordsworth prelude 1.342>	Like harmony in music; there is a dark
<wordsworth prelude 1.343>	Inscrutable workmanship that reconciles
<wordsworth prelude 1.344>	Discordant elements, makes them cling together
<wordsworth prelude 1.345>	In one society. How strange that all
<wordsworth prelude 1.346>	The terrors, pains, and early miseries,
<wordsworth prelude 1.347>	Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused
<wordsworth prelude 1.348>	Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,
<wordsworth prelude 1.349>	And that a needful part, in making up
<wordsworth prelude 1.350>	The calm existence that is mine when I
<wordsworth prelude 1.351>	Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!
<wordsworth prelude 1.352>	Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;
<wordsworth prelude 1.353>	Whether her fearless visitings, or those
<wordsworth prelude 1.354>	That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light
<wordsworth prelude 1.355>	Opening the peaceful clouds; or she may use
<wordsworth prelude 1.356>	Severer interventions, ministry
<wordsworth prelude 1.357>	More palpable, as best might suit her aim.
<wordsworth prelude 1.358>	One summer evening (led by her) I found
<wordsworth prelude 1.359>	A little boat tied to a willow tree
<wordsworth prelude 1.360>	Within a rocky cave, its usual home.
<wordsworth prelude 1.361>	Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in
<wordsworth prelude 1.362>	Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
<wordsworth prelude 1.363>	And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.364>	Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
<wordsworth prelude 1.365>	Leaving behind her still, on either side,
<wordsworth prelude 1.366>	Small circles glittering idly in the moon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.367>	Until they melted all into one track
<wordsworth prelude 1.368>	Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,
<wordsworth prelude 1.369>	Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point
<wordsworth prelude 1.370>	With an unswerving line, I fixed my view
<wordsworth prelude 1.371>	Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,
<wordsworth prelude 1.372>	The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
<wordsworth prelude 1.373>	Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
<wordsworth prelude 1.374>	She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
<wordsworth prelude 1.375>	I dipped my oars into the silent lake,
<wordsworth prelude 1.376>	And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat
<wordsworth prelude 1.377>	Went heaving through the water like a swan;
<wordsworth prelude 1.378>	When, from behind that craggy steep till then
<wordsworth prelude 1.379>	The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,
<wordsworth prelude 1.380>	As if with voluntary power instinct
<wordsworth prelude 1.381>	Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,
<wordsworth prelude 1.382>	And growing still in stature the grim shape
<wordsworth prelude 1.383>	Towered up between me and the stars, and still,
<wordsworth prelude 1.384>	For so it seemed, with purpose of its own
<wordsworth prelude 1.385>	And measured motion like a living thing,
<wordsworth prelude 1.386>	Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,
<wordsworth prelude 1.387>	And through the silent water stole my way
<wordsworth prelude 1.388>	Back to the covert of the willow tree;
<wordsworth prelude 1.389>	There in her mooring-place I left my bark,—
<wordsworth prelude 1.390>	And through the meadows homeward went, in grave
<wordsworth prelude 1.391>	And serious mood; but after I had seen
<wordsworth prelude 1.392>	That spectacle, for many days, my brain
<wordsworth prelude 1.393>	Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.394>	Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts
<wordsworth prelude 1.395>	There hung a darkness, call it solitude
<wordsworth prelude 1.396>	Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes
<wordsworth prelude 1.397>	Remained, no pleasant images of trees,
<wordsworth prelude 1.398>	Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;
<wordsworth prelude 1.399>	But huge and mighty forms, that do not live
<wordsworth prelude 1.400>	Like living men, moved slowly through the mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.401>	By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.
<wordsworth prelude 1.402>	Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!
<wordsworth prelude 1.403>	Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.404>	That givest to forms and images a breath
<wordsworth prelude 1.405>	And everlasting motion, not in vain
<wordsworth prelude 1.406>	By day or star-light thus from my first dawn
<wordsworth prelude 1.407>	Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me
<wordsworth prelude 1.408>	The passions that build up our human soul;
<wordsworth prelude 1.409>	Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,
<wordsworth prelude 1.410>	But with high objects, with enduring things—
<wordsworth prelude 1.411>	With life and nature, purifying thus
<wordsworth prelude 1.412>	The elements of feeling and of thought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.413>	And sanctifying, by such discipline,
<wordsworth prelude 1.414>	Both pain and fear, until we recognise
<wordsworth prelude 1.415>	A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.
<wordsworth prelude 1.416>	Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me
<wordsworth prelude 1.417>	With stinted kindness. In November days,
<wordsworth prelude 1.418>	When vapours rolling down the valley made
<wordsworth prelude 1.419>	A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods
<wordsworth prelude 1.420>	At noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,
<wordsworth prelude 1.421>	When, by the margin of the trembling lake,
<wordsworth prelude 1.422>	Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went
<wordsworth prelude 1.423>	In solitude, such intercourse was mine;
<wordsworth prelude 1.424>	Mine was it in the fields both day and night,
<wordsworth prelude 1.425>	And by the waters, all the summer long.
<wordsworth prelude 1.426>	And in the frosty season, when the sun
<wordsworth prelude 1.427>	Was set, and visible for many a mile
<wordsworth prelude 1.428>	The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,
<wordsworth prelude 1.429>	I heeded not their summons: happy time
<wordsworth prelude 1.430>	It was indeed for all of us—for me
<wordsworth prelude 1.431>	It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud
<wordsworth prelude 1.432>	The village clock tolled six,—I wheeled about,
<wordsworth prelude 1.433>	Proud and exulting like an untired horse
<wordsworth prelude 1.434>	That cares not for his home. All shod with steel,
<wordsworth prelude 1.435>	We hissed along the polished ice in games
<wordsworth prelude 1.436>	Confederate, imitative of the chase
<wordsworth prelude 1.437>	And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn,
<wordsworth prelude 1.438>	The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.
<wordsworth prelude 1.439>	So through the darkness and the cold we flew,
<wordsworth prelude 1.440>	And not a voice was idle; with the din
<wordsworth prelude 1.441>	Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;
<wordsworth prelude 1.442>	The leafless trees and every icy crag
<wordsworth prelude 1.443>	Tinkled like iron; while far distant hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.444>	Into the tumult sent an alien sound
<wordsworth prelude 1.445>	Of melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars
<wordsworth prelude 1.446>	Eastward were sparkling clear, and in the west
<wordsworth prelude 1.447>	The orange sky of evening died away.
<wordsworth prelude 1.448>	Not seldom from the uproar I retired
<wordsworth prelude 1.449>	Into a silent bay, or sportively
<wordsworth prelude 1.450>	Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,
<wordsworth prelude 1.451>	To cut across the reflex of a star
<wordsworth prelude 1.452>	That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed
<wordsworth prelude 1.453>	Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,
<wordsworth prelude 1.454>	When we had given our bodies to the wind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.455>	And all the shadowy banks on either side
<wordsworth prelude 1.456>	Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still
<wordsworth prelude 1.457>	The rapid line of motion, then at once
<wordsworth prelude 1.458>	Have I, reclining back upon my heels,
<wordsworth prelude 1.459>	Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs
<wordsworth prelude 1.460>	Wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled
<wordsworth prelude 1.461>	With visible motion her diurnal round!
<wordsworth prelude 1.462>	Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,
<wordsworth prelude 1.463>	Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched
<wordsworth prelude 1.464>	Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.
<wordsworth prelude 1.465>	Ye Presences of Nature in the sky
<wordsworth prelude 1.466>	And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!
<wordsworth prelude 1.467>	And Souls of lonely places! can I think
<wordsworth prelude 1.468>	A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed
<wordsworth prelude 1.469>	Such ministry, when ye through many a year
<wordsworth prelude 1.470>	Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,
<wordsworth prelude 1.471>	On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,
<wordsworth prelude 1.472>	Impressed upon all forms the characters
<wordsworth prelude 1.473>	Of danger or desire; and thus did make
<wordsworth prelude 1.474>	The surface of the universal earth
<wordsworth prelude 1.475>	With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,
<wordsworth prelude 1.476>	Work like a sea?
<wordsworth prelude 1.477>	Not uselessly employed,
<wordsworth prelude 1.478>	Might I pursue this theme through every change
<wordsworth prelude 1.479>	Of exercise and play, to which the year
<wordsworth prelude 1.480>	Did summon us in his delightful round.
<wordsworth prelude 1.481>	We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven
<wordsworth prelude 1.482>	Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours;
<wordsworth prelude 1.483>	Nor saw a band in happiness and joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.484>	Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.
<wordsworth prelude 1.485>	I could record with no reluctant voice
<wordsworth prelude 1.486>	The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers
<wordsworth prelude 1.487>	With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,
<wordsworth prelude 1.488>	True symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong
<wordsworth prelude 1.489>	And unreproved enchantment led us on
<wordsworth prelude 1.490>	By rocks and pools shut out from every star,
<wordsworth prelude 1.491>	All the green summer, to forlorn cascades
<wordsworth prelude 1.492>	Among the windings hid of mountain brooks.
<wordsworth prelude 1.493>	—Unfading recollections! at this hour
<wordsworth prelude 1.494>	The heart is almost mine with which I felt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.495>	From some hill-top on sunny afternoons,
<wordsworth prelude 1.496>	The paper kite high among fleecy clouds
<wordsworth prelude 1.497>	Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser;
<wordsworth prelude 1.498>	Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,
<wordsworth prelude 1.499>	Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly
<wordsworth prelude 1.500>	Dashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.
<wordsworth prelude 1.501>	Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.502>	A ministration of your own was yours;
<wordsworth prelude 1.503>	Can I forget you, being as you were
<wordsworth prelude 1.504>	So beautiful among the pleasant fields
<wordsworth prelude 1.505>	In which ye stood? or can I here forget
<wordsworth prelude 1.506>	The plain and seemly countenance with which
<wordsworth prelude 1.507>	Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye
<wordsworth prelude 1.508>	Delights and exultations of your own.
<wordsworth prelude 1.509>	Eager and never weary we pursued
<wordsworth prelude 1.510>	Our home-amusements by the warm peat-fire
<wordsworth prelude 1.511>	At evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate
<wordsworth prelude 1.512>	In square divisions parcelled out and all
<wordsworth prelude 1.513>	With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,
<wordsworth prelude 1.514>	We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head
<wordsworth prelude 1.515>	In strife too humble to be named in verse:
<wordsworth prelude 1.516>	Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,
<wordsworth prelude 1.517>	Cherry or maple, sate in close array,
<wordsworth prelude 1.518>	And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on
<wordsworth prelude 1.519>	A thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,
<wordsworth prelude 1.520>	Neglected and ungratefully thrown by
<wordsworth prelude 1.521>	Even for the very service they had wrought,
<wordsworth prelude 1.522>	But husbanded through many a long campaign.
<wordsworth prelude 1.523>	Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few
<wordsworth prelude 1.524>	Had changed their functions; some, plebeian cards
<wordsworth prelude 1.525>	Which Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.526>	Had dignified, and called to represent
<wordsworth prelude 1.527>	The persons of departed potentates.
<wordsworth prelude 1.528>	Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!
<wordsworth prelude 1.529>	Ironic diamonds,—clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,
<wordsworth prelude 1.530>	A congregation piteously akin!
<wordsworth prelude 1.531>	Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,
<wordsworth prelude 1.532>	Those sooty knaves, precipitated down
<wordsworth prelude 1.533>	With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:
<wordsworth prelude 1.534>	The paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,
<wordsworth prelude 1.535>	Queens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,
<wordsworth prelude 1.536>	And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained
<wordsworth prelude 1.537>	By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad
<wordsworth prelude 1.538>	Incessant rain was falling, or the frost
<wordsworth prelude 1.539>	Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;
<wordsworth prelude 1.540>	And, interrupting oft that eager game,
<wordsworth prelude 1.541>	From under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice
<wordsworth prelude 1.542>	The pent-up air, struggling to free itself,
<wordsworth prelude 1.543>	Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud
<wordsworth prelude 1.544>	Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolves
<wordsworth prelude 1.545>	Howling in troops along the Bothnic Main.
<wordsworth prelude 1.546>	Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace
<wordsworth prelude 1.547>	How Nature by extrinsic passion first
<wordsworth prelude 1.548>	Peopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,
<wordsworth prelude 1.549>	And made me love them, may I here omit
<wordsworth prelude 1.550>	How other pleasures have been mine, and joys
<wordsworth prelude 1.551>	Of subtler origin; how I have felt,
<wordsworth prelude 1.552>	Not seldom even in that tempestuous time,
<wordsworth prelude 1.553>	Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.554>	Which seem, in their simplicity, to own
<wordsworth prelude 1.555>	An intellectual charm; that calm delight
<wordsworth prelude 1.556>	Which, if I err not, surely must belong
<wordsworth prelude 1.557>	To those first-born affinities that fit
<wordsworth prelude 1.558>	Our new existence to existing things,
<wordsworth prelude 1.559>	And, in our dawn of being, constitute
<wordsworth prelude 1.560>	The bond of union between life and joy.
<wordsworth prelude 1.561>	Yes, I remember when the changeful earth,
<wordsworth prelude 1.562>	And twice five summers on my mind had stamped
<wordsworth prelude 1.563>	The faces of the moving year, even then
<wordsworth prelude 1.564>	I held unconscious intercourse with beauty
<wordsworth prelude 1.565>	Old as creation, drinking in a pure
<wordsworth prelude 1.566>	Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths
<wordsworth prelude 1.567>	Of curling mist, or from the level plain
<wordsworth prelude 1.568>	Of waters coloured by impending clouds.
<wordsworth prelude 1.569>	The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays
<wordsworth prelude 1.570>	Of Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell
<wordsworth prelude 1.571>	How, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,
<wordsworth prelude 1.572>	And to the shepherd's hut on distant hills
<wordsworth prelude 1.573>	Sent welcome notice of the rising moon,
<wordsworth prelude 1.574>	How I have stood, to fancies such as these
<wordsworth prelude 1.575>	A stranger, linking with the spectacle
<wordsworth prelude 1.576>	No conscious memory of a kindred sight,
<wordsworth prelude 1.577>	And bringing with me no peculiar sense
<wordsworth prelude 1.578>	Of quietness or peace; yet have I stood,
<wordsworth prelude 1.579>	Even while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league
<wordsworth prelude 1.580>	Of shining water, gathering as it seemed
<wordsworth prelude 1.581>	Through every hair-breadth in that field of light
<wordsworth prelude 1.582>	New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.
<wordsworth prelude 1.583>	Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.584>	Which, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits
<wordsworth prelude 1.585>	Are prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss
<wordsworth prelude 1.586>	Which, like a tempest, works along the blood
<wordsworth prelude 1.587>	And is forgotten; even then I felt
<wordsworth prelude 1.588>	Gleams like the flashing of a shield;—the earth
<wordsworth prelude 1.589>	And common face of Nature spake to me
<wordsworth prelude 1.590>	Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,
<wordsworth prelude 1.591>	By chance collisions and quaint accidents
<wordsworth prelude 1.592>	(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed
<wordsworth prelude 1.593>	Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain
<wordsworth prelude 1.594>	Nor profitless, if haply they impressed
<wordsworth prelude 1.595>	Collateral objects and appearances,
<wordsworth prelude 1.596>	Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep
<wordsworth prelude 1.597>	Until maturer seasons called them forth
<wordsworth prelude 1.598>	To impregnate and to elevate the mind.
<wordsworth prelude 1.599>	—And if the vulgar joy by its own weight
<wordsworth prelude 1.600>	Wearied itself out of the memory,
<wordsworth prelude 1.601>	The scenes which were a witness of that joy
<wordsworth prelude 1.602>	Remained in their substantial lineaments
<wordsworth prelude 1.603>	Depicted on the brain, and to the eye
<wordsworth prelude 1.604>	Were visible, a daily sight; and thus
<wordsworth prelude 1.605>	By the impressive discipline of fear,
<wordsworth prelude 1.606>	By pleasure and repeated happiness,
<wordsworth prelude 1.607>	So frequently repeated, and by force
<wordsworth prelude 1.608>	Of obscure feelings representative
<wordsworth prelude 1.609>	Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,
<wordsworth prelude 1.610>	So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,
<wordsworth prelude 1.611>	Though yet the day was distant, did become
<wordsworth prelude 1.612>	Habitually dear, and all their forms
<wordsworth prelude 1.613>	And changeful colours by invisible links
<wordsworth prelude 1.614>	Were fastened to the affections.
<wordsworth prelude 1.615>	I began
<wordsworth prelude 1.616>	My story early—not misled, I trust,
<wordsworth prelude 1.617>	By an infirmity of love for days
<wordsworth prelude 1.618>	Disowned by memory—ere the breath of spring
<wordsworth prelude 1.619>	Planting my snowdrops among winter snows:
<wordsworth prelude 1.620>	Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt
<wordsworth prelude 1.621>	In sympathy, that I have lengthened out
<wordsworth prelude 1.622>	With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.
<wordsworth prelude 1.623>	Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch
<wordsworth prelude 1.624>	Invigorating thoughts from former years;
<wordsworth prelude 1.625>	Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,
<wordsworth prelude 1.626>	And haply meet reproaches too, whose power
<wordsworth prelude 1.627>	May spur me on, in manhood now mature
<wordsworth prelude 1.628>	To honourable toil. Yet should these hopes
<wordsworth prelude 1.629>	Prove vain, and thus should neither I be taught
<wordsworth prelude 1.630>	To understand myself, nor thou to know
<wordsworth prelude 1.631>	With better knowledge how the heart was framed
<wordsworth prelude 1.632>	Of him thou lovest; need I dread from thee
<wordsworth prelude 1.633>	Harsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit
<wordsworth prelude 1.634>	Those recollected hours that have the charm
<wordsworth prelude 1.635>	Of visionary things, those lovely forms
<wordsworth prelude 1.636>	And sweet sensations that throw back our life,
<wordsworth prelude 1.637>	And almost make remotest infancy
<wordsworth prelude 1.638>	A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?
<wordsworth prelude 1.639>	One end at least hath been attained; my mind
<wordsworth prelude 1.640>	Hath been revived, and if this genial mood
<wordsworth prelude 1.641>	Desert me not, forthwith shall be brought down
<wordsworth prelude 1.642>	Through later years the story of my life.
<wordsworth prelude 1.643>	The road lies plain before me;—'tis a theme
<wordsworth prelude 1.644>	Single and of determined bounds; and hence
<wordsworth prelude 1.645>	I choose it rather at this time, than work
<wordsworth prelude 1.646>	Of ampler or more varied argument,
<wordsworth prelude 1.647>	Where I might be discomfited and lost:
<wordsworth prelude 1.648>	And certain hopes are with me, that to thee
<wordsworth prelude 1.649>	This labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!
