"""Handle database interactions related to texts.

Functions in this module interact with the database (MongoDB instance and local
file storage) to store and retrieve information about texts in the Tesserae
instance. This should be the first stop for clients when using Tesserae
functionality.

Functions
---------
retrieve_text_list
    Retrieve the list of available texts.
insert_text
    Insert a new text into the database.
load_text
    Open a .tess file for reading.

    This function will not update the CTS URN of a text. CTS URNs are unique
    identifiers, and changing one indicates a fundamental alteration of the
    text, which should be treated as a new version (and given a unique entry in
    the database).

    If multiple texts with the same CTS URN are discovered in the database, the
    operation will not complete as it is unclear which text to update. This
    indicates an external edit to the database and manual repairs are needed.
